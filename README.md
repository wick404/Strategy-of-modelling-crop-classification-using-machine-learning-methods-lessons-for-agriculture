The paper aims to develop a Europe-wide generalizable crop classification model using data science and machine learning best practices. It combines topsoil data from the LUCAS Topsoil Survey dataset, European biogeographical zones, and agro-meteorological observations from the JRC MARS database. The paper outlines a structured model development process, which includes establishing baseline models, performing feature engineering, data processing, distribution transformation and scaling, applying hyperparameter tuning, conducting feature importance analysis, and constructing a final ensemble model. A range of algorithms were evaluated, including bagging, boosting, linear, and neural network classifiers. Performance was measured using a set of evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and balanced accuracy. The XGBoost classifier achieved the highest single-model performance (F1:0.7033), while the ensemble Stacking Classifier further improved predictions (F1:0.7134). Feature importance analysis through Shapley values revealed that model decisions aligned with some real-world crop production patterns. Despite the challenges encountered with minority class prediction, the paper highlights the potential of machine learning for large-scale agricultural applications.
